# B2B Wholesale Platform - Frontend

This is the Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind CSS frontend application for the B2B Wholesale E-commerce platform.

## Features
- **Modern UI/UX**: Premium aesthetic styling inspired by Stripe/Apple, with CSS glassmorphic cards and dynamic layouts.
- **Context API State**: Global authentication (`AuthContext`) and cart checkout management (`CartContext`) persisted in LocalStorage.
- **MOQ & Slabs**: Checks product MOQ constraint values and applies Tiered Pricing drops (Retailer vs. Wholesale) instantly.
- **Interactive Sandbox Gateways**: Mock interfaces for UPI, Credit Card, and B2B Wallet payments, allowing success/failure overrides.
- **Admin Center**: Track order dispatches, verify delivery OTP codes, and inspect SMS/Email logs inside the browser.
